I have been known to not get off the stage during conferences.

If there are no rigid impositions, I will speak forever.

When it comes to recording virtual talks, I'm no better. I was given a 40-minute slot for the talk and the QA afterward. I ended up recording for 37 minutes.

Well, as they say, you can't shut up great engineers.
