I'm writing this again from an airport. I guess this is a thing now, considering I have written at least four daily logs in airports over the past months.

I'm off to [speak at FOSSASIA Summit](https://eventyay.com/e/7cfe0771/session/8122). This is going to be a busy (but enjoyable) week.

I'm excited to be back in Singapore. Morning runs have great views, there's always a park around the corner, and tons of great food.
