I have two upcoming talks in the next two weeks.

My firsts in 2022. And I hope to speak more at conferences this year.

The first is at [DevConf.cz 2022 on the 29th this month](https://sched.co/siKF) and the second is at [FOSDEM 2022 on the 5th of February](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/community_questions/).

## Measuring Service Mesh Performance 101

This is my talk at DevConf.cz that dives into how the performance of a workload running on top of a service mesh can be benchmarked.

I also look into the tools [Meshery](https://meshery.io/) and [Service Mesh Performance](https://smp-spec.io/)—both Cloud Native Computing Foundation projects I'm a maintainer of—and how they can help in consistent performance benchmarks of these workloads.

## How to ask Good Questions in Open Source Communities

This talk at FOSDEM 2022 is based on my article "[How I Ask Questions as a Software Engineer](/posts/how-i-ask-questions)".

I narrow the scope of the talk to be more specific to open source projects/communities with key takeaways that I think are helpful to every open source contributors.

I am still working on recording this talk and I hope to complete half of it today.
