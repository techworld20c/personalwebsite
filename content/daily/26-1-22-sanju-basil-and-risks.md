How good is the "[Basil meets Sanju](https://youtu.be/r3y6VLsqpYw)" interview?

I have always liked the idea of collision of different worlds but this is on a next level. Both the guys compliment each other really well and it sparks an exciting conversation.

I am heavily invested in cricket and I have been playing it throughout my life. I was a part of my college team who went on to become two time zonal champions.

Sanju Samson is undoubtedly the most popular cricket player in Kerala today. He has always been a person I actively rooted for since the beginning of his career.

His is a tale of the underdog for people in Kerala.

What sparked this post is from this conversation between Sanju and [Basil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Joseph) (a Malayalam film director) is how they took risk in their careers.

Being a professional cricketer and being a professional film maker are highly risky career choices. There would surely be more people who have failed pursuing these dreams than those who were able to make it big.

But the element of risk is not limited to the sports or entertainment industry. Every industry and everyone has to navigate through risk in their lives.

And if they don't, _they aren't challenging themselves._

Quitting a steady, high-paying job was the risk I took back in 2019. I had no idea what would happen next and there were moments after where I questioned my decision.

Fast forward two years, taking this leap of faith has been the best decision I made in my life.

You don't know what is on the other side when you are risking it. It is indeed a leap of faith. But taking calculated risks and jumping off to an abyss are two different things.

When I decided to quit my job, I was confident of my ability to learn new skills, had a vague idea on what I wanted to do and was comfortable financially to take a break from working.

I did not go berserk and quit my job out of the blue. That would have been a stupid decision and I would not be where I am today.

Would I take more risks in the future? Absolutely. Would I be careful in taking risks? You betcha.

Coincidentally, I was reading on how software engineering projects mitigate risks today.
