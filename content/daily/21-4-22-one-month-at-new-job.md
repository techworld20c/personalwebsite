I didn't play Wordle today and I broke my streak for the second time.

But, it has been a month since I started working on Apache APISIX. It has been a difficult month with onboarding to a new job, traveling, making future plans and engaging in community activities both personally and professionally.

I think I was able to make some significant impact in such a short time. In this next month, I would be more impactful. It is going to be full-fledged, "Navendu" mode.

My friend got married today. Being at such events is a slap in the face reminder of how old I've become. Feels like yesterday when we were playing cricket and in the blink of an eye, my dude is getting married.

{{< figure src="/images/21-4-22-one-month-at-new-job/dude-got-married.jpeg#center" title="Dude got married" caption="21st April 2022" link="/images/21-4-22-one-month-at-new-job/dude-got-married.jpeg" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

I'm getting old, but not wise. Okay, Google...
