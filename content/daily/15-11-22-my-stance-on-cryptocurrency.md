I will publish a new article on Friday, which shows my stance on cryptocurrencies.

I have been a fly on the wall all these years without picking a boat. I think I have fundamentally understood the technology and what it claims to achieve.

I have worked closely with blockchain experts at top universities and talked to maintainers of blockchain-related projects like the ones in the Hyperledger ecosystem.

In the wake of what is happening in the crypto world, I think it might be a good time to voice an opinion.

I also think I'm mature enough to think differently if the current atmosphere around cryptocurrencies changes. It's always strong opinions, loosely held.
