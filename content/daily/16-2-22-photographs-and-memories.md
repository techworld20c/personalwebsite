I missed a couple of days of Wordle but my streak hasn't been broken apparently.

Wordle 242 4/6

I went through some of the photos from [my last trips](/daily/13-2-22-varkala-and-punchakkari/) and [my last day](/daily/15-2-22-end-of-an-era/) at Digital University Kerala.

I keep these photos just to look at them in the future. These photos take you back in time and fills you with memories. It tells you stories and you listen to them.

Google Photos nails this by showing you memories from the same day from a different year. I backup all the photos I want to be reminded of. It should work well.

It is late now. I have a busy day tomorrow. Finishing the photos was my last task for the day. I might add more photos if I find anymore!
