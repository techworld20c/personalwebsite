My writing schedule seems to be working well.

I have been consistent on blog posts and newsletter issues for the past couple of months. And it has been great! My writing has vastly improved, and my writing process is smooth.

Now that I have some free time out of work, I want to explore more types of content. I'm particularly interested in interactive articles. I'm not sure what I'll be building yet, but I have some ideas I have been exploring this weekend.

Hopefully, by next year, some of these ideas will see the light, and the blog will be more popular.
