So, I spent the whole weekend on the project I mentioned last time. Turns out, it is really difficult and not worth it for what I'm trying to achieve.

So, I decided to drop the project, but it was a solid try. All my free time was spent on this, and I learned a lot. We are back to the drawing board for now.
