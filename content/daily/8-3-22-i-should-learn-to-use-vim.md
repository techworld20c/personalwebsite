Why _should_ I learn to use Vim? I have been fine using Nano and VSCode all these years.

I could keep using these two going forward and I haven't found any particular use caseâ€”for meâ€”where I would _have_ to use Vim.

To be honest, I want to learn to use Vim because it is cool. And I've heard how it improves your productivity in the long run. But I care more about the _coolness_ part.

I had tried to learn Vim a while back but I just didn't have enough time to continue it. Now, I should have more time in my hands to try this again.

I discovered this cool song today.
