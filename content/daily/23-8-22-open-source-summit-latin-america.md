I spoke at Open Source Latin America a couple of hours ago. It was fun, and I had a few questions during the talk and at the end. People seemed to like it.

It looks like my conference season is going to kick off in September. In my current plan, I have back to back to back conferences starting in the second week. It involves a lot of travelâ€”if everything works out.

I finished my newsletter this week and am already working on the next issue. Tomorrow, I break everything with Kubernetes. I might build my own Pi-based Kubernetes cluster soon.
