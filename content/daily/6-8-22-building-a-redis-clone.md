I built a Redis clone today following the tutorial from [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io/).

This has inspired me to create my own in-memory storage solution. I'm not sure what changes I will makeâ€”I don't know about storage well enough to make informed decisions.

But I learned a lot today. Redis boils down to some simple concepts. Everything is simple at first, and you build on top of the simple stuff. If you look only at the finished codebase, you would not recognize the underlying simplicity of the software. _Confidence stonks._
