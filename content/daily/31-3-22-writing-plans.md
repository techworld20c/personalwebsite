I think I have found my style as a writer.

I have lots to improve but still, writing a lot in the past months and working relentlessly on documentation have helped me.

[Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/index.html) is someone I look up to as a writer. Using simple language to convey intelligent ideas is seamless in his essays.

I'm making a conscious effort to read more and write more.
