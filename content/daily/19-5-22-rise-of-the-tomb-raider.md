As I was writing this, a notification popped up on my screen saying that "Rise of the Tomb Raider" had finished downloading.

Yes, I finished the first game already. It took me three days, and I'm hooked.

The second game looks quite good. There is a lot more stuff to do, but the mechanics remain more or less the same.

I'm reconvinced that video games improve your problem-solving skills. Growing up, playing video games has significantly impacted me and got me into computers and programming. Being able to have fun playing them again is quite refreshing.
