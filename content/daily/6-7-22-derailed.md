You have a busy week, and the next thing you know, you are off the tracks on your daily routines.

I have been missing daily logs and other daily routines for almost three weeks. It sucks.

How do I get off this path, I don't know. But I'm trying to finish off tasks one by one until I'm back to my usual.

My goal is to be back on track by the last week of July.
