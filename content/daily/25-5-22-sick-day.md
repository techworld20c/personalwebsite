I took a sick day from work today. Rested all morning and started to feel better by evening.

Sick days are dull, and by the time I started to feel better, I was back at my computer, resuming work.

I'm not feeling 100% yet and all the traveling over the last weekend took a toll on me. It would take at least a couple of days to get back on track and resume running and working out.

My to-be-read pile is growing again even though I started reading articles on my Kindle. The only reading I did last week was Norwegian Wood which I should be able to finish this week.

I also need to start dropping books if I find them uninteresting. There is very little time to read bland books in one lifetime.
