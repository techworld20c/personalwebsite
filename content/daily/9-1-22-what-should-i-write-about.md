It is really cool to have a place on the internet to post my unfiltered ramblings everyday.

But these aren't read by anyone so it doesn't matter what goes on here (I think).

I have a more serious blog with a _good_ readership and I have close to 200 people subscribed to it.

I want to make it a place to share my experience and learnings. That is what it is now and I plan to make it to fit that goal more.

My niche is "contributing to open source". Most of my followers in Twitter are there because of my threads on the topic.

That is a good niche to write about as there isn't much credible content out there. I'm also an open source contributor and a maintainer and what I write is from my experience. So it is unique and genuine in that regard.

I need to get to routine blogging by February.

Ciao!
