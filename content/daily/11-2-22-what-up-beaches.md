They moved Wordle to the NY Times website. I did today's in four tries but when I went to share the results, the platform was already changed and it did not have my today's play.

So, guess what happened.

Wordle 237 1/6

I'm hitting the beaches today.

It will be two days filled with beaches and cold drinks in tall glasses and I'm super excited. I have always wanted to try working on a beachâ€”like all those remote work influencers.

It should be fun. It should give me an idea of how a digital nomad life would look like.

I'm thinking of making tomorrow daily logs just photos. I am not sure if I would get time to code a gallery for the photos but _I will try._
