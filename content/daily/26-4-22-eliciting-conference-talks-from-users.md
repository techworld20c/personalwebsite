The best way to get new users is to build a great product. If you already have a great product, the next best way is to talk about your product.

But what should you talk about? You already know everything there is to know about the project. You are _burdened_ by knowledge. What do you do?

_You ask the users._

I spent the day talking to R&D, looking at user stories, curating and reading old articles and noting down potential topics that I can speak about at conferences.

I will be ready with a couple of proposals by the end of the week and will be applying to conferences.

I'm also back at that point where I always have Docker running the project I'm working on (Apache APISIX).

_Look ma! I'm doing cloud native!_
