I think I have exhausted all the captions for my Wordle scores.

I'm back on Twitter and back at my content creation game.

I don't know if not being active put a toll on my reach and my engagement or it is just because my tweets aren't good.

I have a tweet scheduled for today which I think might perform well.

I kind of want to tweet about how I started in open source but as I write it, it feels cringe. If anyone is reading this, let me know if I should do it.
