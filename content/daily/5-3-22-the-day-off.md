I took the day off to read.

I'm currently reading _[The Final Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.The_Final_Empire)_, the first book in the _[Mistborn Trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40910-the-mistborn-saga)_.

I'm actually writing this on 6th Morning—a day later—so, I missed copying my Wordle score.

Taking a day off is refreshing and I might keep this up for today and get back to work on Monday.
