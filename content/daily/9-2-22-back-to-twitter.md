I love writing on Twitter.

I started writing only a couple of months back but within these few months, I have managed to build a good following.

The content you write needs to be concise. You are competing for the attention of people scrolling past on a social media platform. _The challenge of getting your content viewed is real_.

But this forces you to write better content and helps you understand what your audience wants.

So, I'm back on Twitter today. I have a couple of tweets and threads lined up ready to go. I will work on these in a single take over the weekend.
