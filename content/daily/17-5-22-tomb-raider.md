I bought the first game in the Tomb Raider trilogy from 2013.

I haven't seriously played a video game since forever. Last I played was probably Watchdogs, circa 2015.

Playing video games wasn't as fun compared when I was still in school. So I eventually stopped playing, moved to a Linux distro and forgot about gaming.

But today, I had this idea to try out a game and I looked into games that run on macOS and found the Tomb Raider trilogy.

I played it for a couple of hours and it was quite fun. I haven't had so much fun playing video games in a long time.

I had stopped myself from investing on gaming but it might be something to look into in the future.
