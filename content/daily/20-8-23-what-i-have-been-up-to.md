There are many more photos, and adding them to a single post will be difficult. So I'm continuing what I have been up to in the past month here.

## Conferences in Singapore and Taipei

A couple of weeks after Malaysia, I had to travel again to Singapore and Taiwan for conferences. I had never been to Taiwan before, so it was exciting.

Taipei was fascinating. I have been to mainland China, and the two were very different.

Taipei had a more English-speaking population than the parts I have been to in China, and it was easy to navigate with excellent public transport with English signage.

Anyway, you are here for the photos:
