I finished reading "[The Defining Decade](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40603783-the-defining-decade)" by Meg Jay.

While deciding what to read next from my list of "[Want to Read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/83926433-navendu-pottekkat?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=to-read)" books (it has 89 books now and it is not getting smaller), a random conversation with a friend led me to [Haruki Murakami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami).

I have read Murakami's works during the initial lockdown days.

I got interested in his writing through a collection of his short stories titled "The Elephant Vanishes". It was right up my alley and I went on to read a lot more of his books.

"[Kafka on the Shore](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4929.Kafka_on_the_Shore)" was as magical as this [TED video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB4FO1itCi0) portrays. It under the genre of _[magical realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism)_ and I may have a taste for this genre.

My favorite book of all time is "[One Hundred Years of Solitude](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/320.One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude)" by Gabriel García Márquez and it has this similar elements of magical realism, bringing magic to the _seemingly_ ordinary.

So here I was, looking at my "Want to Read" pile and I found Murakami's short stories collection "[Men Without Women](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33652490-men-without-women)".

It is in moments like these you are thankful that you own a Kindle. I had the ancient one without a backlight and now I have the [Kindle 10th Gen](https://www.amazon.in/Kindle-10th-Gen/dp/B07FQ4Q7MB).

Getting the book on Kindle was easy and I started reading. _Should I be writing book reviews here?_
