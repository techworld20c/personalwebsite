I think it is so stupid that we have to figure out what we want to do when we are 18.

Think about it. For most people, this is the time when they join a college course and start on a path that would be their career.

Many of those people are comfortable with the life decision they made at 18 and continue to follow that path.

Then there are people like me.

I was sure I wanted to study electrical engineering when I graduated high school. After working some internships in the field, I decided it was not for me and switched to computer science.

I constantly switch what I focus on in computer science. Still, now I'm pretty stable in working on cloud native open source projects.

But is this where I want to be forever?

I enjoy my work and reached here through a painstaking process of trial and error.

More often, I could figure out what I didn't want to do from my past jobs than what I wanted to do. So, through elimination, I found a job that I like completely.

What else do I want to do with my life?

Asking myself this question repeatedly over the past years has helped me understand more about myself and what I value in life.

I'm driven to do certain kinds of work. And I should do more of this work in the future.

I should make it so that I can give my maximum and reach my fullest potential at what I do.

I plan to slowly start with these new goals in the coming months. So stay tuned.
