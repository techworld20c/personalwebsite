Parks and Recreation is the best TV show ever created.

There has never been a show where the characters have authentic relationships, are relatable and develop throughout the show, which makes you fall in love with them.

The show is motivating as well and it has been my go to motivational content.

I still binge the whole series every couple of months. It is still great and I have watched it end-to-end at least 7 times.

Li'l Sebastian is probably the best minor character in the whole show. I leave you with this.
