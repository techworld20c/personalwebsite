Today was my first day off since I started my new job.

I have been taking some days off in the past month when I was in between jobs but this might be the first weekend I'm really taking a day off, no strings attached.

Honestly, I find it difficult to not work on that issue I opened on Friday but I have to learn to take breaks to keep myself from burning out quickly. I'm in it for the long run.

I might categorize myself as a workaholic. I enjoy working and I always haveâ€”it runs in the family.

So, today I spent time reading. I'm thinking of watching a movie as well as I'm writing this.

> If anyone is reading this, do recommend books or movies to me! It is easy to reach out to me.

I might be finally at a job where I can see myself committing. Or at least sticking in and around the field.

In the last two years I have learned about things I'm good at and not so good at and it came as a surprise to me.

And I have been able to successfully market my skills to get great positions in the industry.

I had been quitting jobs and entire career paths after a couple of months but this is something I have been sticking to for the past two and a half years.

David Perell points in [his talk about the impact of abundance of choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdWahlTc3JE) that optionality should be a _means to an end_ and not the end.

In 2022, a lot of usâ€”even in third world countriesâ€”have the privilege of choice. And I see a lot of my peers being confused about this abundance of choice like I was or am to some degree.

We are constantly driven to look for the shiny new thing by social media platforms and we develop this innate FOMO.

I'm not on Facebook and Instagram and I mostly use Twitter and LinkedIn to post my content. I think I'm also comfortable with my own success and the path I paved for myself that I don't get the FOMO quite often.

I do get FOMO when I see digital nomads working on all these exotic and sometimes expensive places. I'm building towards that right now and I'm positive that I will reach there soon. So, FOMO but I'm doing something about it.

This under-commitment translates into other parts of your life including your relationships. All those dating apps and seemingly perfect lives of people on Instagram makes us question our choices.

Shielding myself from these have helped me feel better about my relationships.

And that is the solution to this abundance.

You don't have to shut things off completely but when you have an abundance of things to consumeâ€”be it food, content, or choice of a partnerâ€”be a conscious consumer.

People who have been conscious have benefitted from this abundance and leveraged all these choices to become better than the median.

My work revolves around communities. And what these communities have taught me is that [software is no longer sold\; it\'s adopted](https://orbit.love/blog/software-is-no-longer-sold-its-adopted).

It rained heavily this evening. It is becoming nice and cool as opposed to the hot summer night we should be having instead.

I decided to watch [She\'s Out Of My League](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0815236/) while I was writing this. I'm in mood for some heartwarming comedy.
