I'm speaking at the [Codebar Festival](https://hopin.com/events/codebar-festival-2022) in a couple of hours.

I'll be speaking about _Levelling Up Your Career Through Open Source_.

I'll keep this open till I finish my session.

So, I just finished the session! It went really well and the recording should be edited and uploaded to YouTube in some time.

There were a lot of questions as well and I barely finished answering on time.

Great experience overall. Would love to come back next year.

I went on a small hike afterwards to get some fresh air and to keep my blood pumping.

I ended the evening with this great view.
