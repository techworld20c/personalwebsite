I just finished reading all the open tabs on my email client. I have 38 tabs open on my browser.

I have these many backlogs because I find stuff when I'm working on something important and save it for a later time. This "later time" rarely comes. And when it does, I'm stuck with at least 40 or 50-odd pieces of content.

So, today, I will share what tabs I have open, limiting it to general content:

* [The Graphing Calculator Story](https://www.pacifict.com/Story/)
* [What I've Learned From Users](http://www.paulgraham.com/users.html)
* [Alien Truth](http://www.paulgraham.com/alien.html)
* [Happy 10th Birthday, Sidekiq!](https://www.mikeperham.com/2022/01/17/happy-10th-birthday-sidekiq/)
* [Hello, I am a Developer Advocate](https://medium.com/@joelmarcey/hello-i-am-a-developer-advocate-ff7db13058c7)
* [In praise of ffmpeg](https://drewdevault.com/2022/10/12/In-praise-of-ffmpeg.html)
* [Sound](https://ciechanow.ski/sound/)
* [Roger Federer as Religious Experience](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html)
* [Writing Nonfiction](https://www.brainspodcast.com/episode/writing-nonfiction)
* [What Makes You You](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html?utm_source=Main+List&utm_campaign=07785e1d03-AUTO_ARCHIVE-08&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_5b568bad0b-07785e1d03-55523149&mc_cid=07785e1d03)

I will be happy after I close all those tabs.
