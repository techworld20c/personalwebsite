I have a 95' Royal Enfield Bullet. It was in the shop till April, and now it's back good as new.

I had my fair share of mishappenings with the motorcycle, but I'm slowly gaining confidence.

Today, I spent some time on it, tidying it up and taking it for a ride.

It is an incredible piece of machinery, and they don't make them as they used to. If I sell it now, I can probably make a significant profit.

But still, it is difficult to maintain. I have to learn to maintain it and keep it in top shape.
