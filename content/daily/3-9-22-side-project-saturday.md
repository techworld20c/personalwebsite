I spent the day working on my newsletter and blog. A new newsletter issue and a blog post will be published this Friday.

So far, my writing has been ahead of schedule. But so far, my life has had less chaos, which is unusual. I'm sure it will be chaos starting next week, so I'm happy I'm writing more and on track.

I set up the stable diffusion model on my M1 mac. It's downloading something as I'm writing this, so I haven't had the chance to try it out yet. From what I see on Twitter, it should be really good.

I will share the images I generate with this on my socials.
