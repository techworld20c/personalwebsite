Perez going DNF sucked, but it was a thrilling race.

I wanted the underdog, Kyrgios, to win the finals at Wimbledon, but he didn't.

India lost against England in the T20. Major suck.

We have a table tennis board here, which is nice. Back when I was in my undergrad, we used to play TT all night long. I forgot how fun it was to play.
