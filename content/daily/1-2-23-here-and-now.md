[A year ago](/daily/1-2-22-i-am-sick), I was playing Wordle and was sick. Iâ€™m healthy now, but I tried todayâ€™s Wordle:

Wordle 592 3/6

ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©â¬›â¬›\
â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬›ğŸŸ¨\
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

Is this still a thing?

I added a new [/now](/now/) page to my website. It has details on what I'm up to now. I got the idea from Derek Sivers. You should definitely check outÂ [his site](https://sive.rs)Â and writings.

I plan to create more of these "on-off" pages on the site.

A recommendations page with my top book, movie, TV show, and personal blog recommendations might be a good idea. I just have to make sure that these recommendations are the best. A small set but of excellent quality.
