What a great day to be alive and witness ISRO landing Chandrayaan-3 on the moon. Seeing the joy and sense of achievement of the scientists behind the project was something. I hope this inspires a new generation of engineers, scientists, and spacefarers. _People are awesome._

I re-stumbled across the most viewed TED talk by Sir Ken Robinson, titled "[Do schools kill creativity?](https://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_do_schools_kill_creativity)" He argues that all of us are born creative, and we lose our creativity as we grow up in an educational system tailored to meet the needs of the industrial revolution.

I have been looking back on my days at school, and I believe this to be true as well. I did not have to work very hard to get good grades and spent most of my time off school doing things I liked. I think this has helped me stay at least a bit creative and curious as I find myself working only at creative jobs and being very bored with the menial tasks.

These realizations have been so influential that I have decided to homeschool any children I'm responsible for in the future. At least these hypothetical children won't be joining conventional schools like the ones I have been to and find classes tedious and draining of their innate human nature to be curious and learn.

It is also a good goal to be creative and explore whatever tickles your curiosity.
