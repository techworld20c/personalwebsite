I had given up trying out CMS products yesterday. But after finding how easy it is to use Netlify's open source CMS, I decided to give it another try.

It is super easy to set up but does not do what I want it to do. My blog has a weird folder setup and front matter, which makes it impossible to integrate with the platforms available.

So, I will use my trusty code editor to be my CMS for now. I'm thinking of building a tool that lets me create posts and folders easily. It will be a Golang CLI if I make it.
