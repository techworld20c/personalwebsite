I have been binging Wikipedia articles all evening. I will let the links tell the story.

[A. K. Antony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._K._Antony), [Rajan case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajan_case), [The Emergency (India)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(India)), [Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesavananda_Bharati_v._State_of_Kerala), [Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty-second_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India), [Indira Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi), [Sanjay Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Gandhi), [Feroze Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feroze_Gandhi), [Rajiv Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi), [Sonia Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Gandhi), [Maneka Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneka_Gandhi).

I successfully procrastinated from writing the blog post.
