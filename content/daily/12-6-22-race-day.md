What a race in Azerbaijan today. It sucks to be team Ferrari, but I'm happy for RedBull scoring maximum points.

I was hoping Checo to win the race after a strong weekend, but Max was significantly faster.

This puts Checo right behind Max for the Championship. It will be a hard fight, and Checo has a chance to take it all the way.
