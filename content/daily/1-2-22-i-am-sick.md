I am feeling so sick today.

I have a mild fever and cold. My body hurts all over, I have a blocked nose and a congested chest.

I slept or was in bed most of the day and I have a test to prepare for.

Now I am contemplating how I have taken my health for granted and how good it is to be able to breathe freely through both noses.

I hope I get better tomorrow after a long night's sleep.

I also just realized I haven't pushed my previous commit for yesterday's daily log.
