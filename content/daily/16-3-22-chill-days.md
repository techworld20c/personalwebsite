My old college roommate and I still play this everyday and share scores with each other.

I took a day off. Which was quite rare until recently.

I should be starting a new job soon and I'm trying to take some very needed chill time to energize before I go back to the grind.

To be honest, I'm starting to like taking things easy. 

So, I'm letting it all soak in while it lasts.
