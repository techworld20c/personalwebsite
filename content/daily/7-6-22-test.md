Test cricket is undoubtedly the best format for playing cricket.

You play for five days, and still, some matches hang in the balance until the very last ball. The drama, the tension, and the build-up are unmatched.

I occasionally fall down YouTube rabbit holes when watching cricket videos. It is almost always test match highlights or iconic moments.

I went down one such rabbit hole today.

It was the 2005 Ashes, and I watched Flintoff bowl one of the best spells in cricket. Then I watched Flintoff's textbook fast bowling spell against Kallis, getting him out on the last ball of the over.

There's nothing like seeing a batsman getting bowled out, deceived by the sheer pace and swing of the ball. Cricket is awesome.
