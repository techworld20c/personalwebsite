I'm getting a new microphone today.

I have been using the [Jabra Evolve 20](https://www.jabra.in/business/office-headsets/jabra-evolve/jabra-evolve-20##4993-829-209) for all audio streaming and recording needs and it can get cumbersome.

I have to wear it, and there is a cable and the audio quality is good but not great.

So, I bought the Blue Yeti microphone. Can't wait for it to arrive.

But one of the problems I will face on Monday when I get the microphone is lack of ports. My USB-C hub does not have anymore slots to plug in the USB-A microphone.

I got a USB-C to USB-A hub along with it to make sure that I can connect all my peripherals.

I have no clue whether it will work properly or if I have to buy something else but I hope it does.
