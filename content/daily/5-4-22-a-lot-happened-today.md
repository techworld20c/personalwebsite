Too big of a day to care about my Wordle score.

I had to drop a friend at 1 AM today and I came back to an email saying I got a scholarship to attend [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe - 2022](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) in Valencia, Spain.

I couldn't share how I excited I am if I tried.

This would be my first time in Europe and I always wanted to visit Spain.

I started planning for the travelâ€”booking tickets, scheduling a visa appointment, making an itinerary (nerd)â€”right away and got almost no sleep yesterday.

My Blue Yeti microphone arrived today. I want to say my setup is complete but I could also use a boom arm for the mic. But, I do see how my setup evolved over the last year.

I also went to see a film festival. I did not actually see any films, I was there for _other reasons_.

_Photos coming soon!_
