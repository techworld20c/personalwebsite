I will speak at the Open Source Summit Latin America hosted by the Linux Foundation.

It will be about the Linux Foundation Mentorship Program and how it helped my career.

I spent a big part of the day preparing for it. I have to submit the recording tomorrow. The deadline keeps the creative juices flowing.
