This should have taken at least a step less.

Being back behind an IDE even for a day does ground you a lot.

It hits you in the face with how little you know about the technicalities of the software you are writing and helping to maintain.

_I know nothing_.

I am not the most technically savvy developer. I can write code but I don't see myself as one of those "distinguished engineers" 15-20 years in the future. I can write code but my skills lie in management and that is what I might pursue in the future if I end up having a career.

_I know nothing_.

Accepting you don't know everything and you never will isâ€”contrary to popular beliefâ€”liberating. You come to terms with who you are and what you are capable of.

But this does not mean you are inferior in any way. Everyone has things they don't know. _You accept your imperfections_.

_I know nothing_.

What I do when I don't know something is I ask others for help.

There is nothing wrong with showing others that you don't know something. It took me a lot of time to understand this but now I try to ask questions without caring what people will think.

I am writing more code now. The codebase is changing fast. There is no way to keep track of all the moving parts and you rely a lot on abstractions.

So, when it comes to you having to work on areas that are new to you, you would not know things and you would need to ask questions.

_I know nothing_.
