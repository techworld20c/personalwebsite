It's [DevConf.CZ](https://www.devconf.info/cz/) day today!

I am always excited to speak at conferences. I think it has been a while since I went live on a conference apart from joining in on the panels for Meshery and Service Mesh Performance at KubeCon Project Office Hours.

Truth be told, I was a bit nervous as well. There were a lot of RSVPs to the session which included some very senior engineers.

_The imposter syndrome kicked in on cue._

But, I think the session went well. I am waiting for it to be published on YouTube.

Here is the "photo of the day" featuring me taking an awkward screenshot while the session was being wrapped up.

ABBA is _so_ good. Here is your daily dose of ABBA.
