I had to wake up at 2:50 AM today to catch my flight.

But the view from my balcony in Mumbai was worth it.

{{< figure src="/images/10-4-22-hello-mumbai/view-from-home.jpg#center" title="Hello Mumbai!" caption="Navi Mumbai - April 2022" link="/images/10-4-22-hello-mumbai/view-from-home.jpg" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

I haven't been in a flight since 2015 if I remember correctly. _What did I do these seven years?_

I went to the Central Park in New Mumbai today. Walked around. Great place. Quite unexpected in the middle of the city but this goes to show how important city planning is.

The place is thriving with people.

Have to call it a day a little early.
