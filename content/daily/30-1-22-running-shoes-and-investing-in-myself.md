It wasn't an obvious one today but I got the right letters in the third step and I had already eliminated other possible vowels that could go between the two correct letters.

I think a lot while I run. I don't have any devices with me while I run other than my wristwatch which kind of forces my mind to wander.

It's not like I have _transformative_ thoughts. I thought about running shoes today (I wonder what _could_ be the reason).

I had restarted running back in 2020 in the aftermath of the first nationwide lockdown. I had an old Reebok sneakers I bought when I was in High School and was training to join the army (17 year old me was easily influenced).

Since then, I used the sneakers for pretty much everything. I used it throughout college and was using it on my daily runs after that.

It was pretty much worn out when I started using it on my runs and after a couple of weeks, it took its last breath and gave up. _Hello, cheap sneaker I bought for a valid reason I don't remember._

Don't run 8 km everyday on hard roads with a pair of cheap sneakers. You will hurt your leg and you will hurt it real bad.

I had to quit running because I hurt my ankle _so bad_, I risked permanent injury if I kept at it. I was out for 8 months.

The first thing I did when I was ready to run again was getting a good pair of running shoes.

I spared no expense and bought the [Asics Gel-Nimbus 23](https://www.asics.com/us/en-us/gel-nimbus-23/p/ANA_1011B004-020.html?width=Standard).

I have never had a better running experience. It _is_ a game changer.

Investing on myself and buying what I needâ€”like this pair of Asicsâ€”has had made my life much better. And these pay for themselves in bettering my wellbeing, providing more free time, making me more productive and continuously returning dividends.

I used to shy away from spending too much on myself. But, during the past couple of years, I have learned that these investments are worth it.
