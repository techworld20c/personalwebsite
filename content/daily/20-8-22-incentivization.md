I'm writing about how incentivizing open source contributions can quickly turn into gamification of the system. This will be featured in [my newsletter](/subscribe) this coming Friday.

My newsletter and blog posts are opinionated. I'm not catering to any target audience and being cautious about my writing.

I think being authentic has its rewards. It is essential in a world where everyone is trying to appeal to a broad set of audiences.
