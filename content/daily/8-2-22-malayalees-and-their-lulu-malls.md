Mallus love their LuLus.

LuLu(s) are one of India's largest shopping malls owned by M.A. Yusuff Ali's LuLu Group International.

There are two of them in Kerala with the one in Trivandrum opening last month. Kochi's LuLu mall is so popular that it made all the other malls in the district effectively go bankrupt. Nobody goes to other malls anymore when there is a LuLu mall at the heart of the city a metro ride away.

Anyway, _we went to LuLu Trivandrum today_.

I did not have anything to buy really but went to check out the mall. _Mallus love their LuLus_.

Here's the squad.

We went to watch the [Hridayam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hridayam) movie today before we hit LuLu.

The delightful thing was we went to watch the movie in a cricket stadium. I don't know if this is common knowledge but there is a Carnival Cinemas right inside the Greenfield International Stadium in Trivandrum.

It was fun and I haven't been to the stadium before. _I wish I could play there_.

My 6' friend is bending down to match my 5'8 in the picture above. _Tall people problems, am I right?_

Going back to writing code.

_It will be a busy day tomorrow._
