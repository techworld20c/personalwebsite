The Apple TV series _Pachinko_ deserves all its 5 ⭐ ratings and reviews. I watched the series in the last two days and it is amazing. The storytelling is absolutely impeccable and is definitely one of the best series' I have ever watched.

The series also cleverly uses subtitles as a character in the story itself. I would suggest you watch the series to get what I mean.

I submitted my first talk proposals as a Developer Advocate for Apache APISIX. Is three proposals for a conference a good rule of thumb?
