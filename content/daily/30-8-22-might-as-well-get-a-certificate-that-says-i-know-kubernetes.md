I purchased the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) examination today. I haven't scheduled a test yet, but I will in the coming months after I finish some travel.

I have been working with Kubernetes for the past two years. I haven't learned Kubernetes in a structured way yet, so this would be challenging. And through this challenge, I hope to fill the missing gaps in my knowledge of Kubernetes.

I read a lot these days and thought these two might be good to share today:

* [Measuring demand for a feature: An economics approach](https://austinhenley.com/blog/measuringdemand.html)
* [Some ways to get better at debugging](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/08/30/a-way-to-categorize-debugging-skills/)
