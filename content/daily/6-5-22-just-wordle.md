Wait.

I have been letting my project ideas sit in solitude for some time now. In idle moments, I find myself thinking about the problems I wish to solve with my projects and come up with new ideas.

It took me all these years to realize that thinking about a problem is more important than thinking about a solution. Spend more time thinking about the problem before starting to work on a situation. _I'm sure I'm paraphrasing Newton here._

Anyways, I have a lot of ideas brewing. I'm finding it difficult to be fully devoted to one particular thing—I'm all over the place now—but I should be able to get things in order soon and start working on these ideas.

It's race weekend tomorrow!\
