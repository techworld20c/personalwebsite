I was sick today after a long time.

I was sick in February when I had COVID, but I recovered in a day. Other than that, I have been relatively healthy since 2019.

Being sick and bedridden reminds us of how fragile the human body is. It is good to be grounded now and then to be grateful that we are healthy most of the time.

But what sucked today was we were having a family get-together dinner, and being sick meant I missed out on it.
