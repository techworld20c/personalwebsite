I don't want to "jinx it" by calling this streak.

I spent most of the day refactoring Apache APISIX's Plugin documentation.

It has a lot of Plugins and working on it opened up a can of worms.

I'm focusing my whole week to fix these docs. I'm not even close to completing it but I'm optimistic.

I have to drop off my friend to travel for an interview in a couple of hours. It is already 10:30 PM and it is later than my usual lights off time.

Busy day tomorrow.
