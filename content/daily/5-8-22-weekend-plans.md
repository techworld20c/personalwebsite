Side projects, here I come!

This weekend, I will finally start to work on my side projects. It has been in the cookbook for a long time, and there is no point in waiting anymore.

I found this really cool site [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io/) that walks you through building open source projects like Redis and Docker. I will try it out this weekend, and hopefully, I will come out of it with my Go programming brain restored.
