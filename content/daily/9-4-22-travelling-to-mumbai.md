I found out that I broke my streak the day before. But I'm back and kicking!

I'm travelling to Mumbai tomorrow for my visa appointment.

I will be there for a few days and will be back on Wednesday.

It's been way too long since I've been on a flight. It's 50% cause of the pandemic and 50% because I was super busy and did not even take a single vacation in the last two years.

> I'm done with the no vacation lifestyle. But it had to be done.

I wish I booked my flight a day earlier to catch today's IPL match. _Now what do I do in Mumbai?_
