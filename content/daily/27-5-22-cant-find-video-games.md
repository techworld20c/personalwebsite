I finished _The Rise of the Tomb Raider_ today. Great game. Great storyline.

Now, I'm looking for video games that work on macOS but aren't too compute-intensive that it burns my CPU.

Maybe I shouldn't invest in video games altogether. I have been stopping myself from buying a Playstation for a long time now. Video games aren't bad, but I have a lot of other hobbies and side projects that aren't getting enough attention from me.

I might finish the Tomb Raider trilogy and call it quits from video games. I think I've had enough break from my side projects to make it enjoyable again. Man, I have a lot of side projects to build.

But on the plus side, letting my side project ideas soak for a while has made them much better than I initially thought.

So, future plans: Tomb Raider and then side projects.
