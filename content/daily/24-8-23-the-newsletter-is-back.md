I sent out the last issue of my newsletter in May. It has been over three months since I wrote one of those for reasons you will find in the newsletter ([subscribe now!](/subscribe/)).

But I am back now. And I plan to send out new issues every two weeks like before.

It is almost midnight as I'm writing this. I'm working on a new blog post I intend to publish tomorrow (or Saturday because it hasn't been reviewed yet). I still have to finish some diagrams and test some code before I hit commit and open it for review.

_Tomorrow is going to be a busy day._
