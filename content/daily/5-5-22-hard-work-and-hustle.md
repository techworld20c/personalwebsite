Internet has been criticizing hard work recently. The arguments are valid as the hustle mindset often puts a lot of toll in a person's health and their relationships.

Most people have their "primary" lives outside of work. Work comes secondary and it is perfectly fine. You can even love your job without having it consume your life.

_I totally agree._

But what if, you enjoy working so much that it doesn't feel like work. What if you want to be defined by your life's work? What if your work life is your primary life?

First of all, I don't like the term "work/life balance". My work is an integral part of my life and I want to work on things that take over my life.

Again, it is okay to not feel this way and I'm not criticizing people who have distinctions between their work and personal lives. I'm merely pointing out the fact that some people like working hard. They want to work on things that really interest them. And it is not right to criticize them for enjoying what they do and being okay with it just because you don't feel the same way.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

I have also been curating a playlist of songs I find on TV shows and movies. They aren't mainstream AFAIK and they have lead to discovering awesome artists and bands. Check it out!
