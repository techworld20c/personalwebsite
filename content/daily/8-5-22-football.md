I swear I did Wordle but didn't save the score.

I just binged a season of _[Friday Night Lights](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758745/)_ without knowing anything about American football.

American football is exciting. I hate to admit it, but it is exciting.

I love the strategies, the plays, and the technical aspect of the game more than the physical aspect.

The best part about the series is the relationship between the people in Dillon and the game. It speaks through sports and cultures, and is a global emotion.

Anyway, _I'm going to binge the whole series now._
