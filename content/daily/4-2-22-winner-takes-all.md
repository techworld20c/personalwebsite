It was a good guess today.

I don't remember what I wanted to write today under the title "Winner Takes All".

I only remember deciding the title. It's been hours and I don't think I will remember what I originally intended to write. But, _miracles could happen as I am writing this_.

I _do_ feel like I won today. I finished my 3rd semester exams for completing my Master's Degree.

It was the hardest thing I had ever done in my life. I was also working part-time on a high growth startup and there were a lot of moments where I almost quit. But I am very grateful that I pushed through and made it this far.

The future looks bright today. I have a clear road ahead with no scheduled stops. I can choose to take the detour and drive slowly across the country side or run across the beaches. It is entirely up to me and _me alone_.

This is as liberating as it is horrifying. On one hand, I decide what I am going to do, but on the other hand, _I decide what I am going to do_.

I don't have clear-cut short term goals other than to continue what I am doing. But whatever I do _should_ help build towards my long-term, North star goals.

Open road, _I'm hitting the ground running_.
