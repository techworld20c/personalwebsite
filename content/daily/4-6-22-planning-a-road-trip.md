I'm thinking of going on a road trip—a motorcycle trip—in one of the coming weekends.

I might need to rent a bike because mine isn't ready (I don't think it will ever be prepared for long rides).

I have also been thinking about getting a new bike. There is very little time before these fossil fuel engines are replaced by electric motors. You would not get the same satisfaction from riding the electric ones.

It is a race against time, and I would probably regret it if I didn't go on more motorcycle rides.
