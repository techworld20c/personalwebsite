I published a [new blog post](/posts/hands-on-set-up-ingress-on-kubernetes-with-apache-apisix-ingress-controller/) today. It is a "get your hands dirty" in Kubernetes kind of tutorial.

I'll be working on more hands-on stuff in the following weeks. Most of what you read next will be written at airports. _Conference season September begins_.
