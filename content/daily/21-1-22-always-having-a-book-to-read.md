I always have a book to read. Even if I haven't read it in months, I am _technically still reading_ the book.

Now, I am not at the mercy of the YouTube algorithm to deliver good content. I can go back to my book any time I want instead of scrolling endlessly and falling down rabbit holes in YouTube.

I also have a Kindle which helps me with this process. It is one of the best investments you can make if you are a reader.

I had mostly quit social media in 2020. This happened painlessly.

My phone broke and it only worked when plugged in. I was staying indoors most of the time and with the pandemic, I figured things wouldn't change soon.

So, I _went the entire year_ without a phone.

This gave me time to catch up on reading and build it into a habit—which I still continue today.

I have read countless articles and heard people talk about how short-form content—TikToks, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, Tweets—is affecting our attention span.

> People don't read long articles anymore but if you break it down into a Twitter Thread, it goes viral.

The apps on our phones and computers compete for our attention—however limited—and like it or not, to get your content across, you also need to get in on the competition.

Whenever I think about this, I feel like I'm the old (I'm in my mid 20s) guy in the neighborhood who cringes at kids and doesn't give you back your cricket ball when you hit it to his yard (These kids and their schemes, _back in my day_...).

So yes. I try to keep myself from loosing the OG inside me. I read a lot of books and long articles, watch long documentaries and keep away from posting a filtered picture of my lunch on Instagram.

_I hope I don't succumb to peer pressure._
