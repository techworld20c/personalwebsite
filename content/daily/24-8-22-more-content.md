I invested in some tools to level up my content on the internet.

I'm writing more today. I need to build channels to promote what I write. Creating these channels is difficult, and I hope to use these tools to help.

I'm also in a dilemma. Should I diversify my channels? Or should I stick to what I have now, stabilize it and build an audience before trying other platforms?

For the short term, I will focus on writing. I will build a solid foundation by being consistent. Once I have it running smoothly, I can think about more platforms.
