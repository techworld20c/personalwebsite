Where did the car go?

Coincidentally, me, a long term Formula 1 fan, might very well be in Barcelona the same weekend as the Spanish GP.

After realizing this, I was overcome by excitement and went looking for tickets only to find that they cost way too much. Traveling to Spain is going to put a dent on my finances and if I add a Grand Prix to it, I would total the car.

Anyway, I want Sergio "Checo" Perez to be competitive in this season, really gunning for the title. He is a great driver and he has been given a proven, race-winning car for the first time in his career. If you can win a race from P20 after the first lap, you can win a championship.

Team Red Bull FTW.
