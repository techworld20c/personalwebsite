After finishing the Redis clone from yesterday, I started building a Docker clone.

I did not end up building it, but I learned a lot of new concepts.

I would recommend [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io/) if they finish the platform they are building and have extensive tutorials and explanations. It is a great idea, and I would pay for it.

I have also laid out a plan and scouted some resources to start my first side project. It is a load generator that is small in size, built for the cloud, distributed, and adaptive by default.

I plan to make it scalable so it can run on multiple devices controlled by a central client controller. This would mimic real-world traffic.

I'm announcing it publicly here to hold myself accountable.
