I'm finally able to plan my travels for next month.

I'm neck-deep in working on exciting things. Planning my travel was a distraction. I got my visas on Friday and booked a one-way ticket to Kuala Lumpur yesterday. I have to plan the rest of the trip.

I will be in Malaysia and Singapore for work during the first week of July. I haven't visited Malaysia before, so also I want to explore and do touristy stuff.

I also love going back to Singapore. When I stayed in downtown Singapore, I always went for a morning run through Marina Bay. It is one of the most incredible places to run in the morning. And it is right in the middle of a city!

I will be sure to pack my running shoes for Singapore and flip-flops for the beaches in Kuala Lumpur!
