I stumbled across headless CMS today. Seeing that some of the products had generous free tiers, I decided to try them out.

Now my git commit history is messed up. I tried [forestry.io](https://forestry.io/). It looked promising, but the file path it stored my static content was messed up. And it committed directly to my production branch. No PRs.

To sum it up, I gave up on trying out CMS products. I will ramp up my VS Code setup for now.
