I finished setting up the first issue of [my newsletter](/subscribe/) last week and I have one more blog post to convert from draft. It has been a busy week and it is already late in the week.

So, the first issue of the newsletter is coming out next week. I hope to write one every weekâ€”or maybe once every two week as a start.

I am going to finish the last blog post and call it a day.
