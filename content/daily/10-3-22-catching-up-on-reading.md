I have a lot of open tabs waiting to be read and closed. They are open on Thunderbird and they are open on Brave and they have been for at least a week.

That is a lot of reading and I really want to read these too. Hopefully, I will get to it over the weekend.

I'm speaking at [codebar Festival 2022](https://hopin.com/events/codebar-festival-2022) on Saturday the 12th. I'll be talking about how you can level up our career through open source.

I was preparing for the talk as well today.

Just as I'm writing this I learned that I'm going out to a movie with friends.

It will be a long night.
