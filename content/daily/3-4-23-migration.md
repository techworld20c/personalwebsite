I'm in the process of migrating/redrawing diagrams in this blog from Mermaid.js to PNG diagrams from Canva.

I thought [Mermaid.js was the solution for diagrams](/posts/adding-diagrams-to-your-hugo-blog-with-mermaid/), but there were a lot of shortcomings. It was too much trouble to tune the diagram to look how I wanted, given that I didn't have to update my diagrams a lot.

This process is tedious, but I wanted to create a consistent style guide for my future diagrams. Working through these helped me make many more templates I can reuse/modify in the future.

Today I've been binging Rands in Repose. You can start [here](https://randsinrepose.com/dont-skip-this/).
