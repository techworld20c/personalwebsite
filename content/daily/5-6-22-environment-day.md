Living in a small town has its own set of perks.

You can drive a couple of minutes and reach places like these, away from the clutches of modern life.

People living in the city are shocked to see such natural places and how we are surrounded by them.

After two years of online meetings, I found that you can almost always hear a bird chirping when I'm talking. I think people living here tunes it out, but it stands out for people from the cities.

My house is surrounded by trees. Its only drawback is that we don't get natural light in most rooms. My face is always dark on calls until I put on all the lights here.

Anyway, it was good to go on a little drive and be with nature.
