I don't believe it took me this long to figure out today's word.

It may even be the case that I didn't think it would be a word in the list.

{{< collapse summary="Spoiler below." >}}
Today's word was **Rupee**.

I'm from India.

I have been working in open source for the past two and a half years. It has been the _most rewarding job_ I've ever had.

I'm fortunate to get paid to work on open source things and it is not something most open source contributors have.

I realized how much I love doing this when a friend asked if he could refer me for a job at a consulting firm. I tried my best to not be rude and politely responded that I only intend to work on open source things. I skipped mentioning that I was confident enough to switch jobs _easilyâ€”didn't want to seem too cocky_.

Now I'm _only_ bragging on the internet.

I kid.

Today I read Charity's post titled _[Questionable Advice: The Trap of the Premature Senior](https://charity.wtf/2020/11/01/questionable-advice-the-trap-of-the-premature-senior/)_ and I think more people need to do the same. Especially people who are new to the industry and are working at startups.

I have more to discuss on this topic but to not make some things public right away, I will come back to it inâ€”hopefullyâ€”a couple of days.
