I was obsessed with building charts since I learned how to build them from structured data with code.

But in the last few years, I have switched my focus to engineering and don't get to work with data and charts.

I have been toying with Matplotlib over the weekend for a new article, and I managed to rekindle that passion for charts.

You can expect more articles with charts in the future. They will look fabulous.

My friends say hello.
