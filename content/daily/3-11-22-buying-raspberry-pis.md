After at least half a year of searching, I finally have my hands on aÂ [Raspberry Pi Computer Module 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/compute-module-4/?variant=raspberry-pi-cm4001000).

I have been tinkering around with the CM4 module for the last two days, and I will have some cool projects to share soon.

I found a couple of interesting blogs today:

1. [Gwern Branwen's Essays](https://www.gwern.net/index)
2. [Ribbonfarm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/)
3. [Melting Asphalt](https://meltingasphalt.com/)

I also changed the color scheme of this website to be darker. It gives a "lights out" vibe, which I really like.
