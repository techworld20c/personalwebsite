Oh yea!

Wordle 228 2/6

So, Wordle was bought by The New York Times for more than a million dollars.

This is an awesome news for independent creators and developers worldwide.

Wordle is so simple and yet it captivated millions of people everyday to come in and play the game.

It really puts the independent developer scene under a different light and makes you wonder how things can change overnight.

This news led me to think about what I want to do with my personal projects.

I love building personal side projects. I have been doing it ever since I started coding and was even successful with [NSFW Filter](https://nsfw-filter.com/), gaining 1000+ stars on GitHub and topping its trending page and getting featured on Product Hunt and Hacker News.

I had a few opportunities to monetize NSFW Filter but I ended up choosing not to do it. Users of NSFW Filter are free to donate to the project through Patreon to support its development.

> I just found out that my DevConf presentation on "[Measuring Service Mesh Performance 101](https://youtu.be/hzYy52A1VTw)" has been made public.

I stopped working on NSFW Filter a long time back. The other maintainer also had to take time off from the project. It is an orphaned child now.

I do have a lot of project ideas. I have a Notion page where I jot down these ideas as it occurs to me.

I then go back to these and try to articulate it. I add my crude ideas on how the project should be, how it should function and how it should look like.

I plan to release these projects as open source. It will be freeâ€”at least the "core" would be free initially. I do have plans to monetize some of these projects but that _seems_ far-fetched for now.

I don't want to reveal too many things before I have some projects ready. _2022 is going to be eventful!_

I was listening to this masterpiece while writing this.
