I finished reading "[The Psychology of Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money)" by Morgan Housel today.

It was a real page turner and I finished it in two sittings.

I am just starting another book on my Kindle, "[The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter and How to Make the Most of Them Now](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40603783-the-defining-decade)" by [Meg Jay](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1038942.Meg_Jay).

It has been a while since I read ebooks and this should be a nice change of setting.
