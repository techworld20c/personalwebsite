I have been sharing photos here in the past few days, but like I said the other day, I have been up to a [lot of stuff](/daily/19-8-23-what-i-have-been-up-to/).

So besides all that traveling, talks, and meeting friends, I have been learning about policymaking on the weekends. You might have noticed some [articles related to public policy](/categories/public-policy/) in the last couple of months.

I plan to spend my free time working on policy issues with organizations in India in the future. People must be aware of and participate in policymaking, especially in technology. We need more people who know and have worked in tech, deciding how it should be used in the future.

I see a lot of potential to make changes in India. For that, you need to work with policymakers and government officials and share your expertise. There is no point complaining if you aren't doing anything about it.

So in the future, expect more policy-related stuff on this blog on the weekends!
