It has been a while. I was super busy traveling for work and personal reasons and couldn't find time to write this.

But I just finished writing a long blog post I will publish on Friday. So I have that going for me.

I still have to edit it and make sure that everything is correct, but still, a lot of work is already done.

I'm traveling back from Mumbai to Kerala. So yes, I'm at the airport again.

I will start learning about public policy on weekends through an online course. I don't know where this will end, but I'm super excited.

"Tattoos on my internet" was a phrase I heard from [Simone on the Lex Friedman podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgIo36F6Fsg&pp=ygUZbGV4IGZyaWRtYW4gc2ltb25lIGdpZXJ0eg%3D%3D).
