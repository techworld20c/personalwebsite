I am back from a short vacation in Vietnam. The highlight of the trip was visiting the War Remnants Museum and Cu Chi Tunnels, which gave new perspectives on the Vietnam War.

Another highlight was when a Vietnamese guide greeted me with "Welcome, my communist brother!" because I'm from Kerala. I still don't know if the comment was intended to be sarcastic because of how the Vietnamese government views criticisms against the government.

This isn't the first instance where one of my foreign friends remarked on Kerala's slight communist lean. Anyway, let it be on the record that I'm not a communist.
