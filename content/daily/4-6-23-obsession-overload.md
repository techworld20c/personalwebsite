It is in my fundamental nature to obsess over things. I have learned that it is central to who I am. And it is great.

Everything I do, I do because I'm obsessed with it. Whether it is my work in open source, learning about public policy, creating content, traveling, or my girlfriend. I am obsessed.

There aren't enough hours in a day to cater to all my obsessions. So I must take breaks from one obsession by obsessing over something else.

Being obsessed over things means that I'm sometimes binary. It is mostly "go big" or "go home," which can sometimes be problematic.

There are things that I end up not doing at all because of this. I have to achieve this standard of perfection that I have put on myself when I do something, and I won't do it unless I can strive to reach that standard.

But being obsessed over things is liberating. You can be sure that the things you do are the things you care about. Being obsessed over multiple things and unable to pick one is fantastic because you always have something to obsess over.

I understand as I read this that some of you may be unable to make any sense of this. Yes, it doesn't make any sense.

If you read my newsletter, I frequently write about people and things I obsess over. If you haven't subscribed yet, please do. If you are reading this, I'm sure you will like it.
