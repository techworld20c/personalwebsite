I spent the day refactoring Apache APISIX's "Getting started" guide.

It sounds like an easy enough task but you need to be fully in a user's shoes to craft a good guide.

I'm relatively new to the project so I don't have the "burden of knowledge" that prevents me from realizing the pain points of a user.

The [Open Source 101 community](https://twitter.com/i/communities/1510222506367778820) I started on Twitter is thriving! I plan to reach out to more open source maintainers and content creators on Twitter to help facilitate the community. My goal is to reach 1000 members.

I love writing these daily logs!
