I have started my "work travels" for the year.

I went to two meetups in Bangalore and New Delhi. I wanted to dry-run a couple of talks I had prepared for the year but ended up talking about open source software in general.

I met many people and had an opportunity to build relationships and get invited to more meetups and conferences.

In two weeks, I will speak at [DevOps Asia Summit](https://devopsasiasummit.com/) in Singapore. I have plans to hang back there for a while and meet more of the tech community.

If you are reading this and are in Singapore, hit me up!

Here are some photos from the last few weeks.
