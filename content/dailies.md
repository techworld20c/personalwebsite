Welcome to my daily logs! Here are a few notes (warnings) before you scroll down:

1. This is not my diary.
2. I don't actually write daily. I strive to, but I am busy elsewhere. I hope to change this in the future.
3. These are raw and unedited. I might say stuff and then evolve out of it in a year. The past me is not the present me; the present me is not the future me.
4. Don't read these.
5. Please don't read these.
6. If you ignored the last two warnings, you better [subscribe to this via RSS](/categories/daily-dose-of-pottekkat/index.xml).

On a positive note, there are photos in some of these!
