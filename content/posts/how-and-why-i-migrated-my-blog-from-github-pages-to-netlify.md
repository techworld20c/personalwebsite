This blog is now deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)! I spent a little more than an hour yesterday migrating it from [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to Netlify.

GitHub Pages is a perfect solution for deploying static websites. But, it made it challenging to implement some of the features I wanted on my blog.

So, on impulse and to procrastinate from finishing a blog post, I migrated the site to Netlify!

## What GitHub Pages Lacked

GitHub Pages has been my go-to static website deployment solution for the past three years. And it worked like a charm even if it was free.

I have been looking for ways to set up my Hugo website to show draft blog posts. The problem was that I didn't want these drafts to show up on the homepage listing, but I also wanted a sharable link for people to review.

There are ways I can set this up, but even if I do that, there aren't any ways for people/reviewers to leave feedback on my static website.

I also used a lot of client-side redirects, which is not desirable as opposed to server-side redirects. GitHub Pages did not provide a way for you to configure server-side redirects. So I had to use these [hacky, Jekyll redirects](https://github.com/pottekkat/link-redirect) on a subdomain. It works, but it could be better.

## Enter Netlify

Netlify has [deploy previews](https://www.netlify.com/products/deploy-previews/). So, when you make a pull request to your production branch, Netlify will build the site for you and show a preview of what the change will look like.

{{< figure src="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/deploy-preview-is-ready.png#center" title="Deploy preview feature in Netlify" caption="From [github.com/pottekkat](https://github.com/pottekkat/personal-website/pull/23#issuecomment-1212009294)" link="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/deploy-preview-is-ready.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

You know what this is best for? Previewing draft blog posts!

Using Netlify, I can open a pull request with my draft post, and Netlify will generate a preview build of the site without affecting my production site. Reviewers can see the preview and suggest edits as comments on GitHub.

Netlify also brings a better continuous integration experience.

{{< figure src="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/netlify-ci-checks.png#center" title="CI checks run by Netlify" caption="From [github.com/pottekkat](https://github.com/pottekkat/personal-website/pull/23)" link="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/netlify-ci-checks.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

Netlify lets you configure the build settings through the Netlify UI or a [configuration file](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/) (`netlify.toml`). This gives you a lot more control than the few configuration options GitHub Pages provides.

{{< figure src="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/netlify-dashboard.png#center" title="Netlify dashboard for navendu.me" caption="I added a Plugin and to lint links and it broke the CI because there were a lot of broken links. Task for another day." link="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/netlify-dashboard.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

With Netlify, configuring redirects is as easy as adding two lines to your configuration file. You also have the option to configure the proper status code. Now that's neat.

Netlify also has a DNS service, supports storing large media (Git LFS), has split testing and rollback features, and [more](https://www.netlify.com/github-pages-vs-netlify/#:~:text=Netlify%20is%20your%20all%2Din,Netlify%20is%20the%20obvious%20upgrade.). But, these are only "nice to have" features for me now. _I will not be using these anytime soon\*_.

> _\* I might use these sometime soon._

## How I Migrated to Netlify

The process was pretty straightforward. It only took me a little over an hour to set everything up and test.

In the steps below, I have the following setup:

- A [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) blog published on GitHub Pages.
- A custom domain registered on [Hostgator](https://www.hostgator.in/) (also my DNS service).

You can always refer to the [official Netlify docs](https://docs.netlify.com/get-started/) if you have a different setup somewhere along this guide.

### Create a Netlify Account

First, you must [create a Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com/signup) if you don't have one.

{{< figure src="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/netlify-signup.png#center" title="Create your Netlify account" caption="Do you also use GitHub for everything?" link="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/netlify-signup.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

### Import Your Website

You can now add your website to Netlify. You should have the code for your website on a Git provider. If you don't have one, now is the time to `git push` your code.

1. Click on "Add new site" and "Import project".
   
   {{< figure src="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/import-existing-project.png#center" title="Importing your site" link="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/import-existing-project.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

2. Select the Git provider where you have your website code.
   
   {{< figure src="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/import-from-provider.png#center" title="Select your provider" link="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/import-from-provider.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

3. Pick the repository from the Git provider after granting access to Netlify.
   
   {{< figure src="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/picking-a-repository.png#center" title="Pick the repository to deploy" link="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/picking-a-repository.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

4. You can then configure the build settings based on your blog engine. Since I'm using Hugo, I will add the following configurations.
   
   {{< figure src="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/build-settings.png#center" title="Build settings for my Hugo website" caption="`--gc` cleans up old resources, `--minify` reduces the size of the files and the `public` folder is where Hugo outputs the build" link="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/build-settings.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

And voila! Netlify will automatically build your first deployment. Now, you will be able to see the production URL for your website.

{{< figure src="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/generated-site-name.png#center" title="Production URL of your website" caption="This screenshot is from Netlify's docs" link="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/generated-site-name.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

This URL is unique; you can change it to `yoursitename.netlify.app` or your custom domain.

### Changing the Website URL and Custom Domains

You can change your site URL to anything unique. Once changed, this will be your website's address.

1. From the "Site overview" page, Go to "Domain settings".
2. Click on the "Options" next to the site name and click "Edit site name".
   
   {{< figure src="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/edit-site-name.png#center" title="Edit the generated site name" caption="kung-fu-panda-23 is a cool name" link="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/edit-site-name.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

3. Change the site name and save.

> **Note**: If you use this URL, you might need to change the `baseURL` in your Hugo configuration file to ensure all the links work.

In my setup, I'm using Hostgator as my DNS service and not the Netlify DNS service.

1. In "Domain settings", click "Add custom domain".
2. You can enter the domain you already own or enter something new and purchase the domain. Netlify will set everything up if you are buying a domain.
3. If you are using a domain you already own with an external DNS provider, you will see a warning. You can ignore that and click on "Add domain".
4. You can also set up an SSL certificate from the HTTPS section.
   
   {{< figure src="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/ssl-certificate.png#center" title="Secure your site with an SSL certificate" link="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/ssl-certificate.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

If you use a different DNS service, you need to configure it to point your domain to your Netlify website. You can check the [Netlify docs](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/configure-external-dns/) if you have a different setup than mine.

1. Login to your domain's control panel and open up your DNS configuration. I'm using Hostgator for my domain.
2. Create an A Record with your apex domain and point it to Netlify's load balancer IP address `75.2.60.5`.
3. Then, create a CNAME record for the `www`subdomain and point it to your website address `yoursitename.netlify.app`.

Now, you must wait for the changes to propagate, and you will have your domain configured.

### Configuring Deploy Previews

The main reason to migrate was the deploy previews feature. And it is super easy to set up.

1. Go to "Site settings".
2. Select "Build & deploy" from the side menu and then "Continuous Deployment".
3. Scroll down to "Deploy previews" and set it up as desired. I have enabled it for any pull request against my production branch, and I have also enabled the Netlify Drawer.

That is it. You now have deploy previews!

> **Note**: To ensure that the deploy previews show drafts, I updated my Netlify configuration file (`netlify.toml`) to change the build command for deploy previews.
>
> ```toml title="netlify.toml"
> [context.deploy-preview]
> 	command = "hugo --buildFuture --buildDrafts --gc --minify -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL"
> ```
>
> Here `$DEPLOY_PRIME_URL` is an environment variable that Netlify sets, used to update the site's `baseURL`.

That brings an end to my current setup. It is much better than my earlier setup with GitHub Pages and was pretty easy to migrate. I would definitely recommend Netlify for your static websites.

## Features I Might Add in the Future

This was my first iteration with Netlify. I have a basic setup that more or less does everything I need. But, I might use these other features if they are fruitful.

### Form Handling

I use Mailchimp to handle subscriptions to this blog. If I can find a way to send mass emails, I might set up the free form handling offered by Netlify.

### Split Testing

A/B test blog posts? Yes!

### CDN/git LFS

My blog contains a lot of images. I do my best to compress these images, but I will reach a point where the images are taking too much space, increasing the repo size. If Netlify's solution is better, I might switch to that.

## Too Good to be Free?

Netlify seems too good to be free. I'm on the free tier, and it appears to be generous.

{{< figure src="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/netlify-usage-navendu.png#center" title="My 24 hour Netlify usage" caption="Petition to add a section that shows the carbon footprint on my blog builds. Take that, people flying on private jets!" link="/images/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify/netlify-usage-navendu.png" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

But, it will only be some time until I pass these limits and would end up needing to pay for the service. It is not too much money but seeing that the alternative, GitHub Pages, is free, I cannot stop thinking, "maybe I don't need deploy previews".

I hope I don't have to write a post titled _"How and Why I Migrated My Blog Back From Netlify to GitHub Pages"!_
