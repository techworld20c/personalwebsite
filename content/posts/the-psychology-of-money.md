  Money’s greatest intrinsic value—and this can’t be overstated—is its ability to give you control over your time.

These are my key takeaways from [Morgan Housel](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7499284.Morgan_Housel)'s international bestseller “[The Psychology of Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money)”.

I have kept my learnings to be short and skimmable and I would urge everyone reading this article to _read the entire book_.

The book is only about 240 pages long and it is a fast read. I read it cover to cover in two sittings—_it was a real page turner_.

Housel begins by talking about how people’s financial decisions are less mathematics, graphs and spreadsheets and are more influenced by their personal history, world view, ego, pride and odd incentives.

He drives this point throughout the book through 19 stories and teaches how you can make better financial decisions.

These are my notes—my key takeaways—on what each of these stories teach us.

1. _Everybody’s approach to money is different_ and is shaped by their own beliefs and experiences from different societies, cultures and economic conditions.
2. The _role of luck_ is often unaccounted. You can end up in the wrong side by making good financial decisions and vice versa. People at the top may have benefitted from luck while those at the bottom might have been the casualties of risk.
    - Be careful who you praise and admire.
    - Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.
    - To ease this risk, replicate broader patterns instead of trying to replicate specific individuals.
3. There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need. Your goals are never complete if you start comparing yourself with others. _Keep your goalpost fixed_.
4. The role of _time and compounding_ is important in building wealth. Ask Warren Buffet.
5. Building wealth is easier compared to staying wealthy—it is a different game. Be optimistic that things will work out in the long term even while facing adversity in the short term. _Raise your odds of success_ at a given level of risk.
6. _Failures are okay_. Long list of failures are overcome by a small list of huge successes. Investment firms have huge portfolios and how many of them actually work out and make money?
7. What wealth gives you is the _control of time_. This gives you control over doing what you want, when you want and with who you want. This is the most common variable that makes people happy.
8. No one is impressed by your possessions as much as you are. People admire your possessions and not you. Trying to buy admiration and respect is a _wild goose chase_.
9. Spending money to show you have money is the fastest way to loose money. Wealth is the _money you don’t spend_. It is what you don’t see. It is the ability to do/get things—time, freedom, possessions— in the future.
10. You don’t need a reason to save money. You save money _because you save money_. With compounding, building wealth is more about savings rate than income (over a certain level of income).
11. Investing strategies need _not always be rational_. Making reasonable choices like investing in your own country, investing in stocks you like and investing in family can give advantages. The best portfolio is the one that gives you peaceful sleep at night.
12. Investing is not a hard science to work based on historical evidence. Investors are human and _they are unpredictable_.
    - Experiencing specific events doesn’t necessarily qualify you to know what would happen next.
    - The events that greatly affected the economy could be outliers.
    - Surprises are surprising.
13. Leave _room for errors_ in your decision making. Think about what errors your can financially endure as well what you can emotionally endure.
14. Your financial goals, your career goals, your life goals, change. _Accounting for the unknown is hard_ and it is okay.
15. The hidden price with investing is the ups and downs in the market, the uncertainty and the doubt in your mind. Be prepared to _pay the price_. Nothing is free.
16. People are different and have different goals. Don’t be persuaded by the actions of people who are playing a different game than you. Understand _your goals_ and _your time_ horizon.
17. _Pessimism sounds smarter_ and people are drawn to its reasoning. But, the problems pessimists forecasts are solved by clever and novel solutions leading to optimistic futures.
18. The more you want something to be true, the _more likely you are_ to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true. These “appealing fictions” have significant impact on our investments.
