People can't use what they don't understand.

For open source projects, good documentation is as important as the project itself.

This is a guide to create useful READMEs that is best suited for small open source projects without dedicated websites having extensive documentation.

You can use this guide as a reference and build on top of it for your projects.

## A Useful README

A README file is the first thing a user will see in your project. First impressions last, so it is important to make a good README.

A good README also helps:

- your project cut through the noise and stand out
- your users understand how to use the project
- your contributors contribute to the project

There is not a one-size-fits-all when it comes to usability. But having the following sections can help:

1. **Title and description**: Name of your project and an introduction to what it is about.
2. **Quickstart/Demo**: A short introduction that users can follow to get started quickly with your project.
3. **Installation**: A guide on how users can install your project.
4. **Usage**: Details on how to use the project.
5. **Development**: How users can build a development version of the project on their machines.
6. **Contribute**: Guide for open source contributors looking to contribute to the project.

Considering all these, I have created a [reusable template](https://github.com/pottekkat/awesome-readme) you can fork on GitHub.

Depending on your project, you might have very different README files. The idea is to use this as a reference as you write your README.
