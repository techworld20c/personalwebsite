This page is a work in progress.

All the code and content of this website are publicly available. So should the statistics.

This page contains data and charts/insights from the data that I think you, as readers of my blog, would find interesting/relevant.

As mentioned in my [ethics statement](/about/#ethics-statement), this blog [does not collect](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics) personal data or personally identifiable information.

All data is from the past month (30 days) and will be updated daily.
